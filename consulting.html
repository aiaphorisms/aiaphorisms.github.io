    <p>
      I work with executive teams on <strong>AI product delivery, technical strategy, and operating-model decisions</strong>
      for production systems. Engagements are selective and scoped around decision-critical outcomes.
    </p>

    <p class="text-muted">
      My role is to diagnose what is blocking progress, translate that into a small set of decisions, and (when requested)
      provide architectural stewardship through delivery. Internal teams retain ownership.
    </p>

    <h3>How high-stakes engagements typically start</h3>
    <p>Engagements usually begin with one of the following situations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Launch pressure with a measurable bar:</strong>
        “We need to ship product X in <em>K</em> months with metric <em>Y</em>, but we don’t know if we can get there—or if we have the right team.”
        I help establish a credible plan to reach the bar, define the evaluation spine, and de-risk execution.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Strong hiring, weak ROI:</strong>
        “We recruited top AI talent, but product impact is flat.” I help identify why effort is not translating into outcomes
        (evaluation, ownership, product coupling, incentives, or architecture) and what must change.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>GPU spend without throughput:</strong>
        “We have <em>K</em> GPUs but utilization is low.” I help diagnose the constraint (data, pipelines, training loops,
        evaluation cadence, deployment friction, or organizational bottlenecks) and recommend actions to raise ROI.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Org design for applied science:</strong>
        “We have a VP Engineering and VP Product—how should science be set up, and what candidates do we need?”
        I help define the operating model, interfaces, and hiring profile that makes execution viable.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Model strategy and defensibility:</strong>
        “We don’t own the model—what is our moat?” I help clarify where differentiation can realistically live
        (data, workflows, distribution, evaluation, systems, UX, or domain-specific assets) and how to avoid vendor panic.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Agentic platform ambition:</strong>
        “We want to become an agentic AI platform.” I help assess feasibility, define the platform boundary, specify grounding,
        observability, and safety requirements, and identify the minimal architecture that can scale.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Engagement structure</h3>
    <p>
      Most work begins with a short assessment phase based on structured discussions with architects, engineering leadership,
      and product owners, plus review of architecture, evaluation practices, cost structure, and ownership.
    </p>

    <p>
      The primary deliverable is a concise written executive document (memo or white paper) covering:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>where technical and organizational risk actually lies</li>
      <li>which decisions matter now (and which can wait)</li>
      <li>options, tradeoffs, and exit paths</li>
      <li>quality and rollback criteria required for control</li>
      <li>org and talent constraints that block execution</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-muted">
      If requested, I remain involved during delivery as an architectural advisor—reviewing designs, pressure-testing assumptions,
      and keeping execution aligned with the original decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>Not a fit</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>staff augmentation or team backfill</li>
      <li>open-ended exploration without decision authority</li>
      <li>RFP-driven bake-offs</li>
      <li>engagements where no executive owns outcomes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Contact</h3>
    <p>
      Email <a href="mailto:anjan@smartinfer.com">anjan@smartinfer.com</a>.
      To keep things efficient, include the system/product under consideration, why this matters now, the expected timeframe,
      the decision owner, and what happens if nothing changes in the next six months.
    </p>
