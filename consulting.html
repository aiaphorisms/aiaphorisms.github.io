    <h3>When applied AI systems fail, they fail quietly — until they don’t.</h3>
    <p>
      Across large organizations, AI systems are being pushed into production without clear quality gates,
      ownership, or failure criteria. Early demos succeed; real-world behavior degrades. Costs rise faster
      than value. When issues surface, decisions are already difficult to unwind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work with leadership teams when these risks matter — and when internal teams can’t surface the full
      technical and organizational reality fast enough.
    </p>

    <h3>Operating level and focus</h3>
    <p>
      I work directly with C-level executives and senior technical leaders as an <strong>independent partner</strong>
      on decision-critical AI systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Engagements typically involve systems that are already deployed (or about to be), where decisions made in
      the next few months will have lasting technical, financial, or reputational consequences. My role is to
      provide clarity where uncertainty, optimism, or organizational structure obscure risk.
    </p>

    <h3>How I work</h3>
    <p>
      I take on a small number of engagements each year, focused on <strong>judgment and decision clarity</strong>,
      not staff augmentation.
    </p>
    <p>My work combines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>independent technical assessment</li>
      <li>explicit recommendations grounded in production reality</li>
      <li>optional architectural oversight during execution, when requested</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I am often brought in when leadership needs an external technical partner who can say what internal teams
      cannot — clearly, constructively, and early enough to matter.
    </p>
    <p class="text-muted">
      If I believe an engagement is unlikely to deliver meaningful outcomes, I will say so upfront.
    </p>

    <h3>Typical failure patterns I’m brought in to assess</h3>
    <p>Engagements often start when one or more of the following is true:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI systems demo well but degrade in real usage.</strong> Early success masks brittleness, edge cases, and silent quality regressions that only appear at scale.</li>
      <li><strong>Model choice has become a source of anxiety rather than strategy.</strong> Teams debate GPT vs. Claude vs. open-source models without clarity on tradeoffs, lock-in risk, or what (if anything) constitutes a defensible moat when the model itself is not owned.</li>
      <li><strong>Model and infrastructure costs are growing faster than business value.</strong> Spend increases are justified incrementally, but there is no clear view of marginal return, long-term sustainability, or exit options.</li>
      <li><strong>No clear ownership exists for AI failures or regressions.</strong> When something breaks, responsibility diffuses across research, engineering, product, and platform teams.</li>
      <li><strong>Leadership suspects risk but can’t prove where it lies.</strong> Concerns are discussed informally, but there is no concrete mechanism to surface, measure, or prioritize failure modes.</li>
      <li><strong>Teams are betting heavily on foundation models without rollback or kill criteria.</strong> Architectural decisions are treated as defaults rather than hypotheses, making reversal politically and technically difficult.</li>
      <li><strong>Prior attempts have produced tools, but not confidence.</strong> Dashboards, pipelines, and prototypes exist, yet leadership still lacks trust in system behavior or decision readiness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How engagements typically unfold</h3>
    <p>
      Most engagements follow a clear sequence designed to separate <strong>judgment</strong> from <strong>execution</strong>:
    </p>

    <h4>1. Independent assessment and diagnosis</h4>
    <p>
      I spend time with senior engineers, architects, and engineering leadership to understand the system as it actually
      exists — not how it is described. This includes reviewing architecture, evaluation practices, cost structure,
      organizational ownership, and delivery constraints.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Executive recommendations and written guidance</h4>
    <p>
      Findings are synthesized into a concise written document (often a technical white paper or executive memo) that outlines:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>where risk lies</li>
      <li>which decisions matter most</li>
      <li>viable options and tradeoffs</li>
      <li>what should be stopped, changed, or deferred</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This document is designed to support C-level decision-making, not to prescribe implementation prematurely.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Optional execution oversight and architectural stewardship</h4>
    <p>
      If leadership requests continued involvement, I remain engaged as a technical and architectural advisor during delivery —
      reviewing designs, pressure-testing assumptions, and ensuring execution stays aligned with the original intent.
    </p>
    <p class="text-muted">Ownership and implementation remain with internal teams.</p>

    <h3>Representative engagement types and outcomes</h3>
    <p>
      I focus on decision-critical engagements where clarity, not output volume, is the primary goal. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Determining whether an AI system is ready to scale</strong> — Establishing objective quality, regression, and failure criteria so leadership can make informed go / pause / rollback decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Clarifying model strategy and defensibility</strong> — Assessing reliance on third-party foundation models, identifying where differentiation truly exists, and defining where ownership matters — and where it does not.</li>
      <li><strong>Resetting cost–quality expectations</strong> — Helping leadership understand the real tradeoffs between model choice, inference strategy, cost, and product behavior, and identifying where spend no longer justifies value.</li>
      <li><strong>Bridging research effort to business outcomes</strong> — Diagnosing why experimentation is not translating into impact, and restructuring evaluation, ownership, and incentives to align work with measurable results.</li>
      <li><strong>Exiting unnecessary complexity</strong> — Identifying cases where classical ML, hybrid systems, or simpler architectures outperform foundation-model-centric approaches in reliability, interpretability, or cost.</li>
      <li><strong>Independent technical diligence</strong> — Providing objective assessments of AI maturity, data quality, infrastructure cost structure, and integration risk for acquisitions or strategic investments — beyond demos and pitch narratives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Collaboration and access</h3>
    <p>Effective work requires close collaboration. I typically ask for access to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>senior engineers or architects who understand the system deeply</li>
      <li>product or platform leaders who can make tradeoffs</li>
      <li>executives who own outcomes and priorities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I work best with small, high-caliber teams and fast feedback loops. If skill gaps or resourcing issues materially block
      progress, I raise them early.
    </p>

    <h3>Boundaries and non-fits</h3>
    <p>This work is not a good fit for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>staff augmentation or team backfill</li>
      <li>open-ended exploratory research</li>
      <li>RFP-driven bake-offs</li>
      <li>engagements without clear ownership or decision authority</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you are looking for implementation capacity rather than independent technical judgment and stewardship, there are better
      options than this engagement model.
    </p>

    <h3>Pricing philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      Engagements are fixed-scope and priced based on risk, complexity, and expected impact — not hourly rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initial diagnostic phases are scoped explicitly. Follow-on involvement is proposed only when clarity has been established
      and leadership requests continued support.
    </p>
    <p class="text-muted">
      I do not take on projects unless I believe the expected value justifies the investment.
    </p>

    <h3>Contact</h3>
    <p>
      If you have a focused problem and believe this may be a good fit, email
      <a href="mailto:anjan@smartinfer.com">anjan@smartinfer.com</a>.
    </p>

    <p>To keep things efficient, it helps to include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a brief description of the problem</li>
      <li>why it matters now</li>
      <li>expected timeline</li>
      <li>who owns outcomes on your side</li>
      <li>what happens if this problem is not addressed in the next 6 months</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-muted">
      If it looks like a good fit, I’ll suggest next steps, which may include a short call.
