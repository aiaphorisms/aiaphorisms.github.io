    <!-- AUTHORITY INTRO (short) -->
<p>
  I work with leadership teams on high-stakes technical problems in applied AI, evaluation, and
  large-scale systems—typically when delivery quality, cost, or execution risk matters. I operate
  at the Principal/Director level, bridging research, production reliability, and measurable business outcomes.
</p>

    <!-- INTRO -->
    <p>
      I take on a small number of consulting engagements each year, focused on delivering
      concrete improvements in applied AI systems. My work is hands-on and execution-heavy,
      aimed at teams that need deep technical help, fast iteration, and clear outcomes.
    </p>

    <p class="text-muted">
      Engagements work best when the problem is concrete, the scope is bounded, and success can be defined upfront.
    </p>

    <!-- WELL-SCOPED WORK -->
    <h3>Examples of well-scoped engagements</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>End-to-end evaluation harness for AI products:</strong>
        designing and implementing a complete evaluation framework to measure quality, regressions,
        failure modes, and business impact for production AI systems, including LLM-based products.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Inference optimization and cost–quality tradeoffs:</strong>
        improving the cost-benefit profile of deployed models through inference-time optimization,
        architecture changes, or hybrid systems—without sacrificing product quality.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Domain-specific foundation or reasoning models:</strong>
        building or adapting smaller (&lt;20B parameter) models—LLMs, LRMs, image generation,
        multimodal, or object-detection models—for a clearly defined domain or task, with a focus
        on deployability and ownership.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Classical ML where it still wins:</strong>
        designing and deploying traditional models (random forests, gradient-boosted trees,
        specialized clustering) where they provide superior reliability, interpretability,
        or cost-performance compared to deep learning alternatives.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Agentic AI systems with grounding:</strong>
        building full agent-based AI products that combine retrieval (RAG), multiple models,
        and tools—emphasizing observability, failure handling, and long-term maintainability.
      </li>
<li>
  <strong>Technical due diligence for acquisitions or strategic investments:</strong>
  deep evaluation of AI systems, data pipelines, model maturity, infra cost structure,
  and engineering risks to assess technical soundness, scalability, and integration
  feasibility beyond slideware and demos.
</li>

    </ul>

    <!-- ENGAGEMENT MODEL -->
    <h3>Engagement model and boundaries</h3>

    <p>
      To maximize delivery speed and reduce risk, my default approach is to design and implement
      <strong>standalone, composable components</strong> that integrate cleanly with your existing
      systems, rather than making invasive changes to production codebases.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Minimizes disruption to existing systems and teams</li>
      <li>Reduces legal and IP entanglement around production code</li>
      <li>Produces components that are easier to test, reason about, and maintain</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When helpful, I will review your current architecture and codebase to assess fit and integration
      paths. If I believe an engagement is unlikely to deliver meaningful outcomes, I will say so early.
    </p>

    <!-- COLLABORATION -->
    <h3>Collaboration</h3>

    <p>
      Effective work requires close collaboration. I typically ask for regular access to one
      senior engineer or architect who understands the system well and can answer detailed
      technical questions. Clear context and fast feedback are essential.
    </p>

    <p>
      I prefer working with small, high-caliber teams. If skill gaps or resourcing issues materially
      block delivery, I will raise them early so they can be addressed.
    </p>

    <!-- STRUCTURE & PRICING -->
    <h3>Engagement structure</h3>

    <p>
      Most engagements begin with a short evaluation phase. This is a focused assessment of
      the problem space, constraints, existing systems, and delivery options.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Evaluation phase:</strong> one week (5 days), fixed engagement</li>
      <li><strong>Typical cost:</strong> $25,000</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The evaluation phase ensures dedicated time, focus, and continuity. Follow-on work is scoped
      and priced after this phase, once delivery details and technical complexity are clear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Follow-on engagements are typically <strong>10 weeks or longer</strong>, depending on scope and
      technical difficulty.
    </p>

    <p class="text-muted">
      Travel and compute costs, when applicable, are billed separately.
    </p>

    <p class="text-muted">
      I do not take on projects unless I believe I can deliver meaningful results.
    </p>

    <!-- INTERNATIONAL + LONGER TERM -->
    <h3>International and longer-term engagements</h3>

    <p>
      I am open to international engagements and, in some cases, longer-term work (e.g., six to nine months).
      These engagements work well when the scope, milestones, and success criteria are discussed and agreed upon early.
    </p>

    <p>
      For longer engagements, I prioritize clear phase boundaries, periodic checkpoints, and explicit ownership transitions
      to ensure sustained progress and avoid open-ended commitments.
    </p>

    <!-- RULES OF ENGAGEMENT -->
    <h3>Engagement expectations</h3>

    <p>
      I work most effectively when discussions happen close to decision-making. As a result,
      I typically engage directly with executives or senior technical leaders who own scope,
      priorities, and outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      To keep conversations substantive, I prefer that prospective collaborators review my
      <a href="/technical_articles/index.html">technical writing</a> or prior work before reaching out.
    </p>

    <p>
      I do not participate in technical interviews, coding screens, or exploratory interview-style
      sessions. If we speak, the conversation is focused on a concrete problem and whether an
      engagement makes sense.
    </p>

    <!-- CONTACT -->
    <h3>Contact</h3>

    <p>

    <p>To keep things efficient, it helps to include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>a brief description of the problem</li>
      <li>why it matters now</li>
      <li>expected timeline</li>
      <li>who I would be working with (role/level)</li>
    </ul>
