        <strong>Method and system for classifying queries to improve relevance of search results</strong><br />
        <em>Patent number: 8458213</em><br />
        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Grant</p>
        <p><strong>Filed:</strong> February 28, 2011 | <strong>Date of Patent:</strong> June 4, 2013</p>
        <p><strong>Assignee:</strong> eBay Inc.</p>
        <p><strong>Inventors:</strong> Kent Andrew Edmonds, Qian Zhong, Anjan Goswami, Muhammad Faisal Rehman</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Described herein are methods and systems for promoting item listings that satisfy a query based on the item listings being assigned to certain categories. A query to identify a set of item listings is processed where each item listing associated with an item or service being offered for sale and assigned to a leaf-level category. The scope of the query is determined based on a dictionary of queries or a length of the query when the query is not found in the dictionary. One or more categories are identified based on the scope of the query. A search results page is presented with the item listings from the identified one or more categories.</p>

        <strong>IMAGE-BASED POPULARITY PREDICTION</strong><br />
        <em>Publication number: 20150154503</em><br />
        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Application</p>
        <p><strong>Filed:</strong> February 12, 2015 | <strong>Publication date:</strong> June 4, 2015</p>
        <p><strong>Inventors:</strong> Anjan Goswami, Sung Hwan Chung</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A machine may be configured to access an image of an item described by a description of the item. The machine may determine an image quality score of the image based on an analysis of the image. A request for search results that pertain to the description may be received by the machine, and the machine may present a search result that references the item's image, based on its image quality score. Also, the machine may access images of items and descriptions of items and generate a set of most frequent text tokens included in the item descriptions. The machine may identify an image feature exhibited by an item's image and determine that a text token from the corresponding item description matches one of the most frequent text tokens. A data structure may be generated by the machine to correlate the identified image feature with the text token.</p>

  <strong>Extraction of Keywords for Generating Multiple Search Queries</strong><br />
  <em>Publication number: 20200097600</em><br />
  <p><strong>Type:</strong> Application</p>
  <p><strong>Filed:</strong> September 24, 2018 | <strong>Publication date:</strong> March 26, 2020</p>
  <p><strong>Inventors:</strong> Aditya Sakhuja, Pingping Xiu, Weiping Peng, Edgar Gerardo Velasco, Anjan Goswami</p>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A method is provided for providing a final result set to a user. In some embodiments, the method includes receiving from the user an input question directed to an organization belonging to a particular category. The method includes applying a plurality of rules to the input question, at least one rule being assigned a weight dependent on the particular category to which the organization belongs. The method further includes extracting, based on applying the plurality of rules, multiple collections of keywords and generating a plurality of search queries. Each search query includes a different collection of keywords. The method also includes submitting the plurality of search queries to a database and in response, receiving multiple result sets from the database. The method further includes in response to the input question, providing a final result including a subset of documents included in the multiple result sets to the user.</p>

  <strong>SYSTEM FOR SEARCH QUERY RESULT OPTIMIZATION THROUGH MODELING OF HISTORIC CONSUMER PAYMENT BEHAVIOR AND RELATED METHODS</strong><br />
  <em>Publication number: 20170193573</em><br />
  <p><strong>Type:</strong> Application</p>
  <p><strong>Filed:</strong> January 4, 2016 | <strong>Publication date:</strong> July 6, 2017</p>
  <p><strong>Applicant:</strong> WAL-MART STORES, INC.</p>
  <p><strong>Inventors:</strong> Wei Han, Parikshit Sondhi, Anjan Goswami</p>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Some embodiments include a system. The system includes one or more processors, and one or more non-transitory memory storage devices storing computer instructions configured to run on the one or more processors. The computer instructions are configured to perform acts of: making available multiple items for purchase by an instant consumer; receiving a query from the instant consumer; determining an estimated price range; identifying one or more in-range items of the multiple items; identifying one or more out-range items of the multiple items; and facilitating displaying to the instant consumer a list of the multiple items such that the one or more in-range items are listed before the one or more out-range items in the list. Other embodiments of related systems and methods are also provided.</p>

  <strong>IMAGE QUALITY ASSESSMENT TO MERCHANDISE AN ITEM</strong><br />
  <em>Publication number: 20160154822</em><br />
  <p><strong>Type:</strong> Application</p>
  <p><strong>Filed:</strong> February 4, 2016 | <strong>Publication date:</strong> June 2, 2016</p>
  <p><strong>Inventors:</strong> Anjan Goswami, Naren Chittar, Ali Dasdan, Sanjay Pundlkrao Ghatare, Sandip Namdeo Gaikwad, Sung Hwan Chung</p>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Image-based features may be significantly correlated with click-through rates of images that depict a product, which may provide a more formal basis for the informal notion that good quality images will result in better click-through rates, as compared to poor quality images. Accordingly, an image assessment machine is configured to analyze image-based features to improve click-through rates for shopping search applications (e.g., a product search engine). Moreover, the image assessment machine may rank search results based on image quality factors and may notify sellers about low quality images. This may have the effect of improving the brand value for an online shopping website and accordingly have a positive long-term impact on the online shopping website.</p>

  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A method is provided for generating a ranked list of candidate responders. In some embodiments, the method includes receiving a question from a user and generating a question feature vector representing an intent of the question and a first skill set inferred from the question. The method also includes for one or more candidate responders, generating a candidate feature vector representing a skill set and questions associated with the respective candidate responder; computing a reputation score based on questions and user feedback associated with the respective candidate responder; and computing, based on the question feature vector, candidate feature vector, and reputation score, a probability score representing a prediction of the quality of an answer that would be provided by the respective candidate responder if the input question were routed to the respective candidate responder. The method further includes generating a ranked list of candidate responders using the computed probability scores.</p>
